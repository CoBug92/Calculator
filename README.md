# Calculator
A basic calculator for iOS, written in Swift 3.

Basic iOS Calculator


The goals for this project were simple:

Create a basic calculator that supports the following functionality:

Only basic math will be supported: +, -, *, /
Numbers can be positive or negative.
Decimal values will also be supported.
Improvements that could be made next include:

Add the % operator.
Support landscape orientation.
Support scientific calculator operations.

I'm new to iOS development, so I'm eager to get feedback any aspect of this project.
